Science Museum!
Peppa and her playgroup are visiting the museum.
This way, children!
Follow me!
Here is Miss Rabbit.
Hello, everyone.
Has anyone ever been to a museum before?
Yes!
Good!
Then you know that in a museum you can look but not touch.
Because everything in a museum is very delicate.
Oops!
Yes, these old things break easily.
But today we're going to visit the Science Museum.
Here you can touch everything!
Yay!
Buttons to press!
Wow!
Brilliant!
Ooh, spooky!
Pull on that rope and try to lift the weight.
It's too heavy!
Now try that rope with the pulleys on it.
Wow!
Now it's easy!
My goodness!
How does that work?
Well, it's, um...
The system increases the mechanical advantage proportionally to the number of pulleys.
Yes, that's what I was going to say.
My little brother Edmund is super clever.
Oh, look!
A tube!
Hello!
Suzie Sheephair!
Oh, where are you?
I am here!
Where?
I can't see you!
Let's find the end of the tube!
Here I am!
Hello!
Suzie Sheephair!
Amazing!
Ooh, maybe in the future this could be used for talking to people a long way away.
You mean like a telephone?
Oh, yes.
Telephones exist already, don't they?
Magic balloons!
Get your magic balloons here!
Are they really magic balloons?
Uh, no.
Not really, but they're still pretty amazing.
Do you want to see?
Yes, please!
All we need to do is rub it like this, and then...
The balloon is sticking to the wall.
Magic!
No, not magic, but static.
How does it work?
No idea.
Protons are said to have a charge of plus one electron unit, while electrons have a charge of minus one...
Which explains static.
What was that bang?
Hello, children!
Here is Grampy Rabbit.
Now it's time for some dangerous science.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ooh!
Don't be alarmed.
There is a responsible adult in charge.
Me.
Who wants to ride in this rocket?
Me!
Me!
Me!
Pepper, kindly jump in.
Um, are you sure this is completely safe?
Of course it's safe.
Now, Pepper, put your hands against mine.
On the count of three, push!
One, two, three, push!
Wow!
I'm moving!
Yes!
That's called propulsion!
Ah!
But real rockets use rocket fuel to blast off.
Who wants to fly in this rocket?
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
It has to be someone small.
There's not much room inside.
I'm small!
Perfect!
In you get, Edmund!
And, uh, this is completely safe for children, too?
Yes.
The rocket just flies itself.
No, I meant...
Off you go.
Oh, my goodness!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Lucky the museum has a high ceiling!
And that is how rocket propulsion works.
That was fun!
It was brilliant!
It was, uh, unbelievable.
Pepper loves the science museum.
Everyone loves the science museum.
Hospital.
It is playtime at school.
Pepper and her friends are running around having fun.
Ow!
That hurts!
Are you all right, Pepper?
I've hurt my knee.
Madam Gazelle, Pepper has fallen over.
You've just grazed your knee, Pepper.
First, Madam Gazelle cleans Pepper's knee.
Then she puts a plaster on it.
Does that feel any better?
Yes.
Thank you.
Now, children, you may have noticed that Pedro Pony isn't here today.
Is he late again?
No, Susie.
Pedro is in hospital.
Ooh!
And today we are going to visit him.
This is the hospital.
Pepper and her friends have come to visit Pedro Pony.
Remember, children, stay close to me.
I don't want you getting lost.
Yes, Madam Gazelle!
Excuse me, Mr.
Bull, which way is the children's ward?
Down the steps, double doors, right, left, right, along the corridor, up the stairs, third on your left.
Ah.
Or you could just take the left.
Children's ward!
Pedro will be asleep.
Sick people do a lot of sleeping.
Hello, everyone!
Hello, Pedro!
Why aren't you asleep?
You don't look sick.
I broke my leg and they put it in this plaster cast.
Wow!
The plaster cast helps Pedro's leg get better.
I grazed my knee and I got a plaster too.
Wow!
Do you want to draw on my plaster cast?
Yes, please.
The children are all doing drawings on Pedro's plaster cast.
I'm drawing a football.
I've drawn some flowers.
Mr.
Potato.
A parrot.
And I've drawn a muddy puddle.
Wow!
Thanks, everyone.
You can draw on my plaster too.
OK, I'll draw a little flower.
Thank you, Pedro.
Pedro, what's it like being in hospital?
It's great!
What are the nurses like?
They give me stickers.
Wow!
And they come whenever I press this button.
Who's that, I wonder?
Could it be Pedro?
What do you want, Pedro?
We are very busy.
I've got a bit of an itch.
Even if your leg is itching, we can't take the cast off until your leg is better.
It's not my leg that's itching, it's my ear.
Is that better?
Yes, thank you.
Lunchtime!
What would you like to eat today, Pedro?
Can I have spaghetti and sponge pudding, please?
You'll get your dinner in bed?
Yes!
That looks tasty.
Dr.
Brown Bear has come to see how Pedro is doing.
How are we today, Pedro?
My ear is a bit itchy.
Just here.
I'd say you're almost better.
Visiting time is over.
Bye, Pedro!
Bye, everyone!
Get well soon, Pedro!
Yes, Madam Gazelle!
It is another school day.
Peppa and her friends are playing in the playground.
Madam Gazelle, my plaster has fallen off.
Can I have another one?
You don't need a plaster, Peppa.
Your knee is better.
Oh, yes!
Hello, everyone!
Pedro Pony is back.
Oh, hello, Pedro!
Where's your plaster cast?
They took it off because my leg is better.
Is your leg strong now?
It's stronger than it was before.
It's a super leg!
Can you run on it?
Watch this!
No!
Pedro likes running around having fun.
Everybody likes running around having fun.
Peppa, George and Danny are having a day out on Grandad Dog's boat.
Can we go to Pirate's Island today?
Yes, Danny!
But first, we've got to deliver supplies to my friend, Grampy Rabbit.
Where does Grampy Rabbit live?
On a rock.
On a rock?
Yes, in that lighthouse.
Ahoy there, matey!
I've brought your supplies.
Oh, thank you, Grandad Dog.
I've got my crew with me today.
Danny, Peppa and George.
Visitors?
I haven't had visitors in many a moon.
I get a bit lonely with just the sea and sky for company.
How long have you been here?
Since Tuesday.
Oh.
I've got tales to tell, if you'd like to hear.
No, thanks!
Yes, please!
Well, there's the sea and the sky and I'm learning the banjo.
Would you like to hear a song?
No, thanks!
Yes, please!
I got up this mornin' The sea was still there So was the sky The sea, the sky, the sea, the sky Here's your cheese!
Oh, I've missed cheese!
And a new book!
How to Run a Lighthouse.
Oh, that'll come in handy.
Why is your house called a lighthouse?
I'll show you, Peppa!
The staircase goes round and round to the very top of the lighthouse.
Round and round and round!
It's called a lighthouse because it has this big light at the top.
Wow!
It shines through the dark, helping sailors to find their way.
And when it's foggy, I use this foghorn.
Fog!
That's loud!
No fog today, just sea and sky.
The stories I could tell!
No, thank you!
We've got to go.
We're sailing to Pirate Island!
Goodbye, Grampy Rabbits!
Enjoy the sea and the sky!
See you!
Grandad Dog's boat has arrived at Pirate Island.
Look!
Our sandcastle is still here!
Let's play hide and seek!
Okay!
One, two, three, four, five...
There are not many places to hide on Pirate Island.
Ready or not, here I come!
Found you!
Now, where's George?
Grandad Dog cannot find George anywhere.
I give up!
Where is he?
George was hiding behind Grandad Dog.
Clever George!
Let's set off home before it gets dark.
Oh, it is getting dark.
Don't worry!
The light from Grampy Rabbit's lighthouse will show us the way home.
Grampy Rabbit is ready for bed.
My new book, How to Run a Lighthouse.
Chapter one!
I'll read the rest tomorrow.
Better turn the light out.
Oh, where did the light go?
Do you know what time it is?
I've just turned the lights out.
Yes, we know.
Could you turn the big light on again?
Oh, sorry!
Hooray!
It is getting foggy.
I can't see the light anymore.
It's us again.
Could you sound the foghorn?
Of course.
Fog!
I can hear something.
Grampy Rabbit is guiding them home.
His voice is a foghorn.
This way home!
The parents are here to pick up the children.
Have you had a lovely time?
We went to Pirate Island.
And to a lighthouse.
Grampy Rabbit's lighthouse guided us home safely.
That's nice.
Grampy Rabbit sang a song.
Would you like to hear it?
No, thanks!
Yes, please!
I got up this morning.
Emily Elephant.
Peppa and her friends are going to playgroup today.
The children each have their own hook to hang their coats on.
Today we have a new pupil, Emily Elephant.
Hello, Emily!
Hello!
Emily is a bit shy.
Who would like to show Emily where to hang her coat?
Me, me, me!
Oh, we just need one.
Peppa, can you show Emily where to hang her coat?
Yes, Madam Gazelle.
We each have our own coat.
This one is for you, Emily.
Emily is hanging her coat on her very own coat hook.
Now, Emily, what would you like to do today?
Painting, clay or building blocks?
I don't know.
Maybe building blocks.
And everyone else, painting, clay or building blocks?
Building blocks!
Yay!
My goodness!
Building blocks are popular today.
Everyone wants to sit next to Emily Elephant.
Emily, you put one block on top of another.
Like this.
It's better if you put them side by side.
No, this way, Emily.
This is the right way, Emily.
No, Emily.
Like this.
You are all being very good.
Yes, you are all being very helpful.
But, Emily, how would you play with the blocks?
Um, I'm not very sure.
I might do like this.
Wow!
Emily Elephant is good at building blocks.
It is playtime.
Hooray!
Emily, would you like to play outside with the others?
Yes, please.
Can someone show Emily where we play?
Yes, Madam Gazelle.
At playtime, Peppa and her friends play in the school garden.
Can't catch me!
What a lot of noise!
Let's see who is the loudest.
OK, I'll go first.
Squeak, squeak!
That was quite loud.
Now it is Zoe Zebra's turn.
Now Susie Sheep.
Now Danny Dog.
That was very loud.
My turn.
My turn.
My turn.
Peppa is the loudest.
Emily, you try.
I'm not too sure.
Please, Emily.
OK, I'll try.
My goodness!
That was loud!
Wow!
Do it again.
Emily is not shy anymore.
Emily, would you like to play my favourite game?
What is your favourite game?
Jumping in muddy puddles.
That's my favourite game too.
Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
Emily loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
This looks like fun.
Yippee!
Madam Gazelle loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
Emily, have you enjoyed your first day at our playgroup?
Yes, Madam Gazelle.
I see you've made lots of new friends.
Yes.
Emily Elephant is my friend.
And Emily is my friend.
And mine.
Emily, who do you like best?
I like Susie and Danny and Zoe.
And Rebecca.
And Pedro.
And Peppa.
Wow!
Gorgeous friend.
Peppa and her friends are at the playground.
Peppa, Susie and Danny are on the raft.
Are you all ready?
Ready!
Then let's go!
Whee!
Faster, faster!
Up, up!
Whee!
George is a bit too little for the roundabout.
He is playing on the swing.
Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother, Richard Rabbit.
Squeak!
Hello, everyone!
Squeak!
Squeak!
Hello!
Can I come on the roundabout too?
Hop on, Rebecca!
Let's go really, really fast.
Squeak!
Richard Rabbit wants to go on the roundabout too.
Oh, if Richard gets on, it means we can't go fast.
Richard can play with George.
Richard, would you like to play with George?
No!
George is a dinosaur just like yours.
Let's go and see.
Richard Rabbit is the same age as George.
Richard wants to see George's dinosaur.
Grrr!
Dinosaur!
George, can Richard play with your dinosaur?
No!
Richard, can George play with your dinosaur?
No!
George and Richard do not want to share their dinosaurs.
George, it will be much more fun if you share.
That was really nice of George.
Dinosaur!
Whee!
George does not like sharing.
Richard, let George hold the dinosaurs now.
Richard does not like sharing either.
What's all this crying about?
George and Richard always cry when they play together.
They're just too little to play properly.
Can you two big girls teach them to play together?
Of course.
We can help them make sandcastles.
Good idea.
Let's go to the sandpit.
Whee!
Whee!
George and Richard love the sandpit.
George, Richard, today we are going to make sandcastles.
First, we fill the buckets with sand.
We turn the buckets over and give them a little tap.
Now we lift the buckets.
Hey presto!
Richard has made a sandcastle.
Hey presto!
And George has made a sandcastle.
Squeak!
Squeak!
You see, playing together is fun.
Oh dear, this game has not gone very well.
It was your brother's fault.
He broke George's sandcastle.
Your brother broke my brother's sandcastle first.
Now, now.
You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together.
That's right.
We're big girls.
And George and Richard are too little to play together properly.
Hmm.
I've got an idea.
George, what's your most favourite thing in the whole playground?
Seesaw!
George loves the seesaw.
Seesaw.
It is a bit difficult to play on a seesaw on your own.
Squeak!
Squeak!
Richard wants to play on the seesaw.
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
Look!
George and Richard are playing together.
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
George likes Richard.
Richard likes George.
George and Richard like playing together.
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
Seesaw!
Traffic Jam Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are making lunch for Peppa and her family.
I've dug up some more potatoes.
Oh, Grandpa.
We've already got plenty of potatoes.
You can never have too many potatoes.
OK.
But get the potatoes in the oven.
The others will be here soon.
Ho-ho!
We've plenty of time.
It's only eleven o'clock.
Peppa and her family are on their way.
I wish we'd set off sooner.
We're going to be late again.
Don't worry, Mummy Pig.
We've still got loads of time.
We're always late when we go to Granny and Grandpa's.
Ho-ho!
Not this time.
I've found a new way that avoids all the traffic.
Oh!
I wasn't expecting that.
Peppa and her family are stuck in a traffic jam.
Look!
There's Danny Dog and Grandad Dog.
Danny Dog and Grandad Dog are in the traffic jam too.
Hello, Peppa!
Ruff!
Ruff!
Hello, Peppa!
Ruff!
Ruff!
We're going to my Granny and Grandpa's for lunch.
We're going to be late.
It's one o'clock.
They're late, as usual.
How are your potatoes doing?
Um, they still need a bit more cooking.
Granny Pig speaking.
Hello, Granny Pig.
We're stuck in a traffic jam.
Don't worry.
We're running late too.
Grandpa's gone over the top with potatoes.
See you in a bit.
The poor dears are stuck in a traffic jam.
Sounds like I've got time to get a few more potatoes.
Grandpa Pig.
We're moving so slowly.
We'll never get to Granny and Grandpa's.
Peppa's right.
We have to try a different way.
But there aren't any other main roads.
I know a shortcut.
Bye-bye, everyone.
We're taking a shortcut.
Bye-bye, Peppa.
Good luck!
Mummy Pig is taking a shortcut to get ahead of the traffic.
The shortcut is very bumpy.
This is fun.
Are you sure about this?
Trust me.
Hello, ducks.
We're taking a shortcut.
Look.
There's the main road again.
Well done, Mummy Pig.
But we're still behind Danny's lorry.
Hello.
Welcome back.
Oh, dear.
Mummy Pig's shortcut has not worked very well.
Good.
Lunch is ready.
And most important of all, the potatoes.
Lunch is ready, but Peppa and her family are still not here.
Grandpa Pig speaking.
We're almost at your house.
But the traffic is still moving at the speed of a snail.
A very, very slow snail.
They're almost here, but they're still in the traffic jam.
We'll have to wait a bit longer.
They're almost here, but they're still in the traffic jam.
Poor dears.
The food is going to get cold.
I've got an idea.
I'll get my wheelbarrow.
What is Grandpa Pig doing?
Granny Pig, load the lunch into the wheelbarrow.
Aye, aye, Grandpa Pig.
If they can't come to the lunch, we have to take the lunch to them.
Look, there's Granny and Grandpa with our lunch in a wheelbarrow.
Ahoy there.
Lunch is served.
Is there enough for Danny and Grandad Dog to have some too?
We've got enough for everyone.
Hooray, potatoes!
Good job you did lots and lots of potatoes, Grandpa.
You can never have too many potatoes.
George's birthday.
Today is George's birthday.
It is very early in the morning.
George, it's too early.
Dineshaw.
Go back to bed.
It sounds like someone's up bright and early.
Happy birthday, George.
George woke me up.
You woke everyone up on your birthday, Peppa.
That was different.
That was my birthday.
And today is Danny's birthday.
That was my birthday.
And today is George's birthday.
Happy birthday, George.
Here's your present, George.
Dineshaw!
I knew it would be some sort of dinosaur thingy.
Squeeze its tummy.
Too scary!
George, I've made you a birthday card.
Can you guess what the picture is?
George cannot guess.
I was going to paint you a flower.
George does not like flowers.
But in the end, I painted you a...
Dineshaw!
That's a lovely picture, Peppa.
Yes, I'm very good at painting.
Now, we're going somewhere very special for George's birthday treat.
Yippee!
Let's go!
Where are we going?
You'll see.
The family are setting off for George's birthday treat.
Are we going to the circus?
No, but it's somewhere just as good.
Is it the cinema?
No, much better.
I just can't guess.
Where can they be going?
We're here!
The family have arrived at the museum.
Why are we at the museum?
Come on, you'll see.
What can George's birthday treat be?
George, what do you like best in the whole world?
Dineshaw!
Ooh, Dineshaw!
George's birthday treat is a visit to the museum dinosaur room.
Silly old dinosaurs again.
Dineshaw!
Don't be frightened, George.
It's not a real dinosaur.
It's just a robot.
Look, I stand on this spot and...
And now, there's another surprise.
All of George and Peppa's friends are here.
Surprise!
Mummy Rabbit has made a birthday cake for George.
Can anyone guess what sort of cake it is?
A dinosaur cake?
It is!
What an amazing guess, Peppa!
It's a dinosaur cake.
It's a dinosaur cake.
It is!
What an amazing guess, Peppa!
Happy birthday, George!
There's one last surprise.
Follow me.
What is the last surprise?
What do you think it is, Peppa?
It's probably something to do with dinosaurs.
Oh, what's that?
It just needs to be filled with air.
I know, I know!
It's a bouncy castle.
Peppa loves bouncy castles.
But if it's for George, why isn't it something to do with dinosaurs?
It is a dinosaur.
A bouncy dinosaur.
Hooray!
George loves bouncy dinosaurs.
Everyone loves bouncy dinosaurs.
This is great!
Happy birthday, George!
Cuckoo clock.
It is early morning.
Mummy and Daddy Pig are still asleep.
Wakey, wakey, Mummy and Daddy!
What?
It's time to get up.
It's much too early.
Don't you know what time it is, Peppa?
No, Daddy.
Our clock doesn't work.
Oh, dear.
Let's see if we can mend it.
Ah!
The old cuckoo clock.
Why is it called a cuckoo clock?
There's a little wooden bird inside, called a cuckoo.
I've never seen the cuckoo.
That's because we stopped winding it a long time ago.
The cuckoo got a bit annoying.
Oh.
Can we wind it up again, please?
All right.
Daddy Pig is winding up the cuckoo clock.
There!
Daddy Pig sets the clock to the right time.
It is nearly nine o'clock.
Daddy, can we see the cuckoo now?
You'll see the cuckoo soon.
What does she look like, Daddy?
Now, let me think.
She moves her head like this.
And she flaps her wings like this.
And she says...
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
What a noisy little cuckoo you are, George.
Cuckoo!
Look!
It's going to do something.
Wow!
Silly George.
You missed the cuckoo.
The cuckoo was really, really brilliant.
She went...
Cuckoo!
And you missed it.
Never mind, George.
You can see cuckoo next time.
But you'll have to wait.
Cuckoo only comes out once an hour.
Waiting is boring.
Come on, George.
Let's play outside.
George does not want to play outside.
He is waiting to see cuckoo.
It is nearly ten o'clock.
George has been waiting for cuckoo for almost an hour.
George!
Come and play!
Mr Dinosaur wants you to play too.
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Dinosaur.
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
George has missed cuckoo again.
Never mind, George.
Why don't you play in the garden?
I'll call you when it's time to see cuckoo.
To you, George!
It is nearly eleven o'clock.
Peppa!
George!
Time to see cuckoo!
Quick, George!
You can't miss cuckoo again.
George is running faster than he has ever run before.
Peppa!
Peppa!
George, did you see cuckoo?
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Peppa and George love playing cuckoos.
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
It is night time.
Peppa and George are very sleepy.
Cuckoo!
Peppa and George are asleep.
Peppa!
Peppa!
Is it morning already?
No, time to sleep.
Cuckoo is not very well.
She just needs to sleep, like you and George.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, my little piggies.
George, I know how to make cuckoo better.
We'll wind her up like Daddy did.
Mummy and Daddy are fast asleep.
What?
Mummy!
Daddy!
We've got something to show you.
We've made cuckoo better.
Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!
